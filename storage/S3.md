# Amazon S3

- Object based storage.
- Infinetly scalable.
- Read after write consistency.

## Buckets

- Name must have a globally unique name (across all regions, all accounts).
- Defined at the region level.
- Storaes objects.

## Objects

- Key : Full PATH. Composed of prefix + object name.
- Object values are the content of the body.
- Max Size: 5 TB.
- If uploading more than 5GB, must be "multi-part upload".
- If versioning enabled, objects have a version ID.

## Security

- **User-Based**:
  - **[[IAM]] policies**: wich API calls should be allowd for a user.
- **Resource-Based**:
  - **Bucket policies**: bucket-wide rules. Allow cross-account access.
  - ACL. Can be disabled.
  - Bucket ACL. Can be desabled. Less common.

## Versioning

- Enabled at the bucket level.
- Same key overwrite will change the version: 1, 2,3...
- Easy roll back, useful in case of accidental deletion.

## Replication

- **Must have versioning enabled** in source and destination.
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**. Compliance, lower latency, replication across accounts.
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**. Log aggregation, replicate prod and test accounts.
- Buckets can be in different accounts.
- Asynchronous replication.
- After enabling replication, only new objects will be replicated.
- Can replicate existing objects using **Batch Replication**.
- For DELETE operations:
  - Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional).
  - Deletions with version ID are not replicated.

## Storage Classes

Every class has 99.99999999999%, (11 9's) durability across multiple AZs.

- **Standard**: General purpose, frequently accessed. 99.99% availability.
- **Standard Infrequent Access**: Infrequently accessed, but rapid access when needed. Lower storage cost. 99.9% availability.
- **One-Zone Infrequent Access**: Same as Standard-IA, but stored in a single AZ. 99.5% availability.
- **Glacier Instant Retrieval**: Minimum storage duration 90 days. Retrieval in milliseconds.
- **Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: Minimum storage duration 90 days.
  - Expedited retrieval: 1-5 minutes.
  - Standard retrieval: 3-5 hours.
  - Bulk retrieval: 5-12 hours.
- **Glacier Deep Archive**: Minimum storage duration 180 days.
  - Standard retrieval: 12 hours.
  - Bulk retrieval: 48 hours.

### Intelligent-Tiering

- Small monthly monitoring and auto tiering fee.
- Move objects between tiers based on access patterns.
- No retrieval fees.





## Requester Pays

- Requester pays network and downlaod cost
- use to share large data sets with other accounts
- user must be autherized in aws 

## S3 event notifications
- trigger an action (lambda) on api request to the bucket
- can also use event bride for more targets and filters

### Targets
- [[Lambda]]
- [[SNS]] 
- [[SQS]]
- can take more than 1 min to trigger

## S3 Access Logs
- monitor traffic requests to an S3 bucket
- can be used for access and security audits
- helps understand s3 bill

## MFA-protected API Access
- enforce MFA for access to S3 resources

## MFA delte
- enforce MFA for delete object action

## Versioning
- if an object is updated the old version still persists within the bucket
- if an object is deleted the new version will be a delete marker, and the old version will still persist within the bucket

## Commands 

### S3 Sync
- copies objects between buckets
- does diff
- used last modified to update
- if versioned only copies current version
```bash
aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET
```

## Storage Tiers
- can transition to infrequent access only after 30 days

### Glacier
- some applications can save data directly into Glacier (e.g. Tape gateway, data sync) , you can also do this manually by using cli
- snowball transfer cannot be directly inserted only transfered from default tier
- low cost but higher retrieval cost and time
- retrieve within 12 hours

#### Expedited Retrival
- 1 to 5 minutes of retrival time 

#### Provisoned Retrival Capacity
- guranteed up to 150mbs retrival speed

#### Glacier Deep Archive
- 75% cheeper than Glacier
- higher retrieval feed than glacier
- no expedited retrieval
- can retrieve at lower fee using bulk retrieve but this will take 48 hours

### Infrequent Access
- less freq access, but instantly available
- low per GB Storage price
- retrival fee

### One Zone / One Zone IA
- single AZ storage 20% less cost

## Lifecycle Rules

### Transiton Actions
- move to different storage tier after time
- can transition to infrequent access only after 30 days

### Transfer Limitations for Lifecycle Rules
![[Pasted image 20221101123650.png]]

### Expiration Actions
- delete access logs
- delete old versions of files
- delete incomplete multi part uploads
- can apply to paths or full bucket

## Tranfer Accelerator
- fast transfer over long distances
- uses cloudfront edge locations
- routes via optimized path

## Multipart uploaads
- transmit object in chuncks
- if one chunk fails, only that chunk needs to be retransmitted
- over 100mb should be considered
- improved throughput

## S3 Bucket Policies
- add or deny permissions to objects
- can be attached to users groups or buckets
- can grant access to other aws accounts
- can restrict based on multi coditions for the requets (ip, time, ssl)

## ACL
- can also use ACL to grant another account access

## Encryption

### SEE S3
- Server Side encryption of objects 
- aws managed
- replication by default

### SEE C
- Server Side encryption
- customer managed keys
- objects can not be replicated

### SSE KMS
- Need to specify need key for object in new bucket
- need iam role to decrypt with source key and encrypt with new key
- might get [[KMS]] throttling errors, need to ask for service quotas increase
- can use multi region kms keys 

### Client Side Encryption
- Encrypt before upload and decrypt after download using own mechanism

## Replication
- must have versioning in both buckets
- can be cross region or same region
- can be bucket in other account
- async
- use batch replication to replicate existing ones
- cant chain replication

### Use cases
- compliance
- latency
- replication across accounbts
- log aggregation
- sync data to test account from prod

## Performance
- 100-200ms
- 3,5k put copy post delte per prefix
- 5,5k read per prefix
- use multi part upload for parallell upload
- transfer accel to upload to edge location instead of directyl to s3, also use for dl if files are bigger than 1GB
- byte range fetches -> multi part download

## Select
- filter data server side to reduce network cost (100 lines out of 1 mil lines csv)

## Batch operations
- modify all metadata and properties
- copy objects between buckets
- encrypt all unencrypted objects
- modify acl and tags
- restore objects from glacier
- invoke lambda for each object
- use s3 select to filter then batch

## Vault
- Objects can not be modified or deleted
- used for compliance
- Can lock the vault policy from future edits

## Server Access Logging
- If [[CloudTrail]] is not enough information you use this

### Features
- including referer
- including turn around time
